"The format uses placeholder names formed by ``$`` with valid Python "

"Threading is a technique for decoupling tasks which are not sequentially "

"in another thread."

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:197
msgid ""
"The principal challenge of multi-threaded applications is coordinating "
"threads that share data or other resources.  To that end, the threading "
"module provides a number of synchronization primitives including locks, "
"events, condition variables, and semaphores."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:202
msgid ""
"While those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems "
"that are difficult to reproduce.  So, the preferred approach to task "
"coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread "
"and then use the :mod:`queue` module to feed that thread with requests from "
"other threads. Applications using :class:`~queue.Queue` objects for inter-"
"thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, "
"and more reliable."

msgid "Weak References"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python does automatic memory management (reference counting for most objects "
"and :term:`garbage collection` to eliminate cycles).  The memory is freed "
"shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:254
msgid ""
"This approach works fine for most applications but occasionally there is a "
"need to track objects only as long as they are being used by something else. "
"Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes them "
"permanent. The :mod:`weakref` module provides tools for tracking objects "
"without creating a reference.  When the object is no longer needed, it is "
"automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is triggered for "
"weakref objects.  Typical applications include caching objects that are "
"expensive to create::"

"Many data structure needs can be met with the built-in list type. However, "
"sometimes there is a need for alternative implementations with different "
"performance trade-offs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:295
msgid ""
"The :mod:`array` module provides an :class:`~array.array()` object that is "
"like a list that stores only homogeneous data and stores it more compactly.  "
"The following example shows an array of numbers stored as two byte unsigned "
"binary numbers (typecode ``\"H\"``) rather than the usual 16 bytes per entry "
"for regular lists of Python int objects::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:308
msgid ""
"The :mod:`collections` module provides a :class:`~collections.deque()` "
"object that is like a list with faster appends and pops from the left side "
"but slower lookups in the middle. These objects are well suited for "
"implementing queues and breadth first tree searches::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:329
msgid ""
"In addition to alternative list implementations, the library also offers "
"other tools such as the :mod:`bisect` module with functions for manipulating "
"sorted lists::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:339
msgid ""
"The :mod:`heapq` module provides functions for implementing heaps based on "
"regular lists.  The lowest valued entry is always kept at position zero.  "
"This is useful for applications which repeatedly access the smallest element "
"but do not want to run a full list sort::"

"For example, calculating a 5% tax on a 70 cent phone charge gives different "
"results in decimal floating point and binary floating point. The difference "
"becomes significant if the results are rounded to the nearest cent::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib2.rst:379
msgid ""
"The :class:`~decimal.Decimal` result keeps a trailing zero, automatically "
"inferring four place significance from multiplicands with two place "

"decimal quantities."
