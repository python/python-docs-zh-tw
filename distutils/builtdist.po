"A \"built distribution\" is what you're probably used to thinking of either "
"as a \"binary package\" or an \"installer\" (depending on your background).  "
"It's not necessarily binary, though, because it might contain only Python "
"source code and/or byte-code; and we don't call it a package, because that "
"word is already spoken for in Python.  (And \"installer\" is a term specific "
"to the world of mainstream desktop systems.)"

"A built distribution is how you make life as easy as possible for installers "
"of your module distribution: for users of RPM-based Linux systems, it's a "
"binary RPM; for Windows users, it's an executable installer; for Debian-"
"based Linux users, it's a Debian package; and so forth.  Obviously, no one "
"person will be able to create built distributions for every platform under "
"the sun, so the Distutils are designed to enable module developers to "
"concentrate on their specialty---writing code and creating source "
"distributions---while an intermediary species called *packagers* springs up "
"to turn source distributions into built distributions for as many platforms "
"as there are packagers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../distutils/builtdist.rst:26
msgid ""
"Of course, the module developer could be their own packager; or the packager "
"could be a volunteer \"out there\" somewhere who has access to a platform "
"which the original developer does not; or it could be software periodically "
"grabbing new source distributions and turning them into built distributions "
"for as many platforms as the software has access to.  Regardless of who they "
"are, a packager uses the setup script and the :command:`bdist` command "
"family to generate built distributions."

"then the Distutils builds my module distribution (the Distutils itself in "
"this case), does a \"fake\" installation (also in the :file:`build` "

"platform.  The default format for built distributions is a \"dumb\" tar file "
"on Unix, and a simple executable installer on Windows.  (That tar file is "
"considered \"dumb\" because it has to be unpacked in a specific location to "
"work.)"

"setup.py install``.  (The \"right place\" is either the root of the "
