"A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such "
"that for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u "
"comes before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the "
"graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent "
"constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this example, "
"a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A complete "
"topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed "
"cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph."
