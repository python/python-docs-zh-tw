"We recommend that all application designers seriously consider doing this; "
"we have seen many protocols where a hash that is computed in one part of the "
"protocol can be used in an entirely different part because two hash "
"computations were done on similar or related data, and the attacker can "
"force the application to make the hash inputs the same. Personalizing each "
"hash function used in the protocol summarily stops this type of attack."
