"The design of all built-in operating system dependent modules of Python is "
"such that as long as the same functionality is available, it uses the same "
"interface; for example, the function ``os.stat(path)`` returns stat "
"information about *path* in the same format (which happens to have "
"originated with the POSIX interface)."
