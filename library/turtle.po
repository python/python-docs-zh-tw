"The turtle module makes this possible by exposing all its basic "

#: ../../library/turtle.rst:190

"It's worth noting that many of the turtle commands also have even more terse "

"You'll need to have the :mod:`Tk interface package <tkinter>` installed on "

"might be imported)."

"The solution is to use ``import turtle`` - ``fd()`` becomes ``turtle.fd()``, "
