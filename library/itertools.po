"This module implements a number of :term:`iterator` building blocks inspired "

"For instance, SML provides a tabulation tool: ``tabulate(f)`` which produces "

"These tools and their built-in counterparts also work well with the high-"

"example, how ``starmap()`` and ``repeat()`` can work together.  The recipes "
