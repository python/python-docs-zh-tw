msgid ":mod:`itertools` --- Functions creating iterators for efficient looping"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements a number of :term:`iterator` building blocks inspired "
"by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML.  Each has been recast in a form "
"suitable for Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/itertools.rst:20
msgid ""
"The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are "
"useful by themselves or in combination.  Together, they form an \"iterator "

"efficiently in pure Python."

#: ../../library/itertools.rst:25

"For instance, SML provides a tabulation tool: ``tabulate(f)`` which produces "
"a sequence ``f(0), f(1), ...``.  The same effect can be achieved in Python "
"by combining :func:`map` and :func:`count` to form ``map(f, count())``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/itertools.rst:29
msgid ""
"These tools and their built-in counterparts also work well with the high-"
"speed functions in the :mod:`operator` module.  For example, the "
"multiplication operator can be mapped across two vectors to form an "
"efficient dot-product: ``sum(map(operator.mul, vector1, vector2))``."
