":mod:`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using "
"an API similar to the :mod:`threading` module.  The :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping "
"the :term:`Global Interpreter Lock <global interpreter lock>` by using "
"subprocesses instead of threads.  Due to this, the :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a "
"given machine.  It runs on both POSIX and Windows."
