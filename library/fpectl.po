"The :mod:`fpectl` module is not built by default, and its usage is "
"discouraged and may be dangerous except in the hands of experts.  See also "
"the section :ref:`fpectl-limitations` on limitations for more details."

"Most computers carry out floating point operations in conformance with the "
"so-called IEEE-754 standard. On any real computer, some floating point "
"operations produce results that cannot be expressed as a normal floating "
"point value. For example, try ::"

"(The example above will work on many platforms. DEC Alpha may be one "
"exception.) \"Inf\" is a special, non-numeric value in IEEE-754 that stands "
"for \"infinity\", and \"nan\" means \"not a number.\" Note that, other than "
"the non-numeric results, nothing special happened when you asked Python to "
"carry out those calculations. That is in fact the default behaviour "
"prescribed in the IEEE-754 standard, and if it works for you, stop reading "
"now."

"In some circumstances, it would be better to raise an exception and stop "
"processing at the point where the faulty operation was attempted. The :mod:"
"`fpectl` module is for use in that situation. It provides control over "
"floating point units from several hardware manufacturers, allowing the user "
"to turn on the generation of :const:`SIGFPE` whenever any of the IEEE-754 "
"exceptions Division by Zero, Overflow, or Invalid Operation occurs. In "
"tandem with a pair of wrapper macros that are inserted into the C code "
"comprising your python system, :const:`SIGFPE` is trapped and converted into "
"the Python :exc:`FloatingPointError` exception."

"Setting up a given processor to trap IEEE-754 floating point errors "

"Conversion of an IEEE-754 exception to a Python exception requires that the "
"wrapper macros ``PyFPE_START_PROTECT`` and ``PyFPE_END_PROTECT`` be inserted "

"to support the :mod:`fpectl` module, but many other codes of interest to "
