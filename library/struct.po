"When constructing format strings which mimic native layouts, the compiler "
"and machine architecture determine byte ordering and padding. In such cases, "
"the ``@`` format character should be used to specify native byte ordering "
"and data sizes.  Internal pad bytes are normally inserted automatically.  It "
"is possible that a zero-repeat format code will be needed at the end of a "
"format string to round up to the correct byte boundary for proper alignment "
"of consective chunks of data."
