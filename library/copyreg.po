"The :mod:`copyreg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`copy` modules use "
"those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides "
"configuration information about object constructors which are not classes. "
"Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "

"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*.  *function* must return either a string or a tuple "
"containing between two and six elements. See the :attr:`~pickle.Pickler."
