"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary "
"Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are included, as "
"well as many other objects which are not representable as Python literals."
