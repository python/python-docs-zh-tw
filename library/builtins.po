"This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; "
"for example, ``builtins.open`` is the full name for the built-in function :"
"func:`open`.  See :ref:`built-in-funcs` and :ref:`built-in-consts` for "
"documentation."

"This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but "
"can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-"
"in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For "

"wraps the built-in :func:`open`, this module can be used directly::"
