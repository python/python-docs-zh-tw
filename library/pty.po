"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return "
"value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the *fd* is "
"*invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, and *fd* is "
"a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling terminal (and also to "
"the child's standard input and output)."

"Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current "
"process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on "
"reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process "
"spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does *spawn* "

"order to force spawn to return before the child process exits an empty byte "
"array should be returned to signal end of file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:64
msgid ""
"The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to "
"1024 bytes each time the function is called. The *master_read* callback is "
"passed the pseudoterminal’s master file descriptor to read output from the "
"child process, and *stdin_read* is passed file descriptor 0, to read from "
"the parent process's standard input."

"Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an end-"
"of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after that. If "
"*stdin_read* signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer communicate "
"with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child process will "
"quit without any input, *spawn* will then loop forever. If *master_read* "
"signals EOF the same behavior results (on linux at least)."
