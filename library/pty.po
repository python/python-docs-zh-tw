"The :mod:`pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal "
"concept: starting another process and being able to write to and read from "
"its controlling terminal programmatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:19
msgid ""
"Pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent. This code is mainly "
"tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS (it is supposed to work on other POSIX "
"platforms but it's not been thoroughly tested)."

msgid "The :mod:`pty` module defines the following functions:"

#: ../../library/pty.rst:28
msgid ""
"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return "
"value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the *fd* is "
"*invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, and *fd* is "
"a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling terminal (and also to "
"the child's standard input and output)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:37
msgid ""
"Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using :func:`os.openpty` if possible, or "
"emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file descriptors "
"``(master, slave)``, for the master and the slave end, respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:44
msgid ""
"Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current "
"process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on "
"reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process "
"spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does *spawn* "
"will return."

msgid ""
"A loop copies STDIN of the current process to the child and data received "
"from the child to STDOUT of the current process. It is not signaled to the "
"child if STDIN of the current process closes down."

#: ../../library/pty.rst:54
msgid ""
"The functions *master_read* and *stdin_read* are passed a file descriptor "
"which they should read from, and they should always return a byte string. In "
"order to force spawn to return before the child process exits an empty byte "
"array should be returned to signal end of file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:59
msgid ""
"The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to "
"1024 bytes each time the function is called. The *master_read* callback is "
"passed the pseudoterminal’s master file descriptor to read output from the "
"child process, and *stdin_read* is passed file descriptor 0, to read from "
"the parent process's standard input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:65
msgid ""
"Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an end-"
"of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after that. If "
"*stdin_read* signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer communicate "
"with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child process will "
"quit without any input, *spawn* will then loop forever. If *master_read* "
"signals EOF the same behavior results (on linux at least)."
