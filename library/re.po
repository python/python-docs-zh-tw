"Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (:class:"
"`str`) as well as 8-bit strings (:class:`bytes`). However, Unicode strings "
"and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode "
"string with a bytes pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a "
"substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the "
"pattern and the search string."

"Regular expressions use the backslash character (``'\\'``) to indicate "
"special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking "
"their special meaning.  This collides with Python's usage of the same "
"character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a "
"literal backslash, one might have to write ``'\\\\\\\\'`` as the pattern "
"string, because the regular expression must be ``\\\\``, and each backslash "
"must be expressed as ``\\\\`` inside a regular Python string literal. Also, "
"please note that any invalid escape sequences in Python's usage of the "
"backslash in string literals now generate a :exc:`SyntaxWarning` and in the "
"future this will become a :exc:`SyntaxError`. This behaviour will happen "
"even if it is a valid escape sequence for a regular expression."

"正規表示式使用反斜線字元 (``'\\'``) 表示特別的形式，或是使用特殊字元而不調用"
"它們的特殊意義。這與 Python 在字串文本 (literal) 中，為了一樣的目的使用同一個"
"字元的目的相衝突；舉例來說，為了配對一個反斜線文字，一個人可能需要寫 ``'\\\\"
"\\\\'`` 當作模式字串，因為正規表示式必須是 ``\\\\``，而且每個反斜線在一個普通"
"的 Python 字串文本中必須表示為 ``\\\\``。另外，請注意在 Python 的字串文本中使"
"用反斜線的任何無效跳脫序列目前會產生一個 :exc:`SyntaxWarning`，而在未來這會變"

"The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular expression "
"patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal "
"prefixed with ``'r'``.  So ``r\"\\n\"`` is a two-character string containing "
"``'\\'`` and ``'n'``, while ``\"\\n\"`` is a one-character string containing "
"a newline.  Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw "
"string notation."
msgstr ""
"解決方法是對正規表示式模式使用 Python 的原始字串符號；反斜線在一個以 ``'r'`` "
"為前綴的字串文本中不會被用任何特別的方式處理。所以 ``r\"\\n\"`` 是一個兩個字"
"元的字串，包含 ``'\\'`` 和 ``'n'``，同時 ``\"\\n\"`` 是一個單個字元的字串，包"
"含一個換行符號。通常模式在 Python 程式中會使用這個原始字串符號表示。"
