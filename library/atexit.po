"The :mod:`atexit` module defines functions to register and unregister "
"cleanup functions.  Functions thus registered are automatically executed "
"upon normal interpreter termination.  :mod:`atexit` runs these functions in "
"the *reverse* order in which they were registered; if you register ``A``, "
"``B``, and ``C``, at interpreter termination time they will be run in the "
"order ``C``, ``B``, ``A``."

"At normal program termination (for instance, if :func:`sys.exit` is called "
"or the main module's execution completes), all functions registered are "
"called in last in, first out order.  The assumption is that lower level "
"modules will normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must "
"be cleaned up later."

"Starting new threads or calling :func:`os.fork` from a registered function "

"Remove *func* from the list of functions to be run at interpreter shutdown. :"

"of that function in the :mod:`atexit` call stack will be removed.  Equality "
"comparisons (``==``) are used internally during unregistration, so function "
"references do not need to have matching identities."
