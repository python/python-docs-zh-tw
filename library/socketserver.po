"These four classes process requests :dfn:`synchronously`; each request must "
"be completed before the next request can be started.  This isn't suitable if "
"each request takes a long time to complete, because it requires a lot of "
"computation, or because it returns a lot of data which the client is slow to "
"process.  The solution is to create a separate process or thread to handle "
"each request; the :class:`ForkingMixIn` and :class:`ThreadingMixIn` mix-in "
"classes can be used to support asynchronous behaviour."

"Creating a server requires several steps.  First, you must create a request "

"process incoming requests.  Second, you must instantiate one of the server "
"classes, passing it the server's address and the request handler class. It "
"is recommended to use the server in a :keyword:`with` statement. Then call "
"the :meth:`~BaseServer.handle_request` or :meth:`~BaseServer.serve_forever` "

"attribute *daemon_threads*, which indicates whether or not the server should "
"wait for thread termination.  You should set the flag explicitly if you "

"Of course, you still have to use your head!  For instance, it makes no sense "

"On the other hand, if you are building an HTTP server where all data is "

"In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request "

"Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an "
"environment that supports neither threads nor :func:`~os.fork` (or where "
"these are too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an "
"explicit table of partially finished requests and to use :mod:`selectors` to "
"decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new incoming "
