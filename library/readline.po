"The :mod:`readline` module defines a number of functions to facilitate "
"completion and reading/writing of history files from the Python interpreter. "
"This module can be used directly, or via the :mod:`rlcompleter` module, "
"which supports completion of Python identifiers at the interactive prompt.  "
"Settings made using  this module affect the behaviour of both the "
"interpreter's interactive prompt  and the prompts offered by the built-in :"
"func:`input` function."
