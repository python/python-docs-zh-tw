"This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of *msg*, returning "
"the string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, "
"and it skips over any subpart with a payload that isn't a Python string.  "
"This is somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the "
"message from a file using :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline`, skipping over all "
"the intervening headers."
