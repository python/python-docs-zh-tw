"From the perspective of this ABC, a *resource* is a binary artifact that is "
"shipped within a package. Typically this is something like a data file that "
"lives next to the ``__init__.py`` file of the package. The purpose of this "
"class is to help abstract out the accessing of such data files so that it "
"does not matter if the package and its data file(s) are stored in a e.g. zip "
"file versus on the file system."

"For any of methods of this class, a *resource* argument is expected to be a :"
"term:`path-like object` which represents conceptually just a file name. This "
"means that no subdirectory paths should be included in the *resource* "
"argument. This is because the location of the package the reader is for, "
"acts as the \"directory\". Hence the metaphor for directories and file names "
"is packages and resources, respectively. This is also why instances of this "
"class are expected to directly correlate to a specific package (instead of "
"potentially representing multiple packages or a module)."
