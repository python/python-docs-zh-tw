"Tcl is a dynamic interpreted programming language, just like Python. Though "

"interface to the Tk toolkit. The Tcl library has a C interface to create and "
"manage one or more instances of a Tcl interpreter, run Tcl commands and "
"scripts in those instances, and add custom commands implemented in either "
"Tcl or C. Each interpreter has an event queue, and there are facilities to "
