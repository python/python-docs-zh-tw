"While :ref:`reference-index` describes the exact syntax and semantics of the "
"Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard "
"library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the "
"optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions."

":ref:`reference-index`\\ 說明 Python 這門語言確切的文法及語意，而這份函式庫參"
"考手冊則是說明隨著 Python 一起發佈的標準函式庫，除此之外，其內容也包含一些時"

"Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of "
"facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The "
"library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to "
"system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible "
"to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide "
"standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. "
"Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the "
"portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into "
"platform-neutral APIs."
msgstr ""
"Python 的標準函式庫是非常龐大的，其提供了如下所述極多且涵蓋用途極廣的許多模"
"組。包含一些用 C 語言撰寫，可以操作像是檔案讀寫等系統相關功能的內建模組，當然"
"也有用 Python 撰寫，並使用標準解法解決許多常見問題的模組。其中有些模組則是特"
"別針對 Python 的可攜性去設計的，為此特地將一些平台特殊相依性的功能抽象化成可"
"跨平台的 API。"

"The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire "
"standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-"
"like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of "
"packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with "
"the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components."
msgstr ""
"Python 的 Windows 安裝檔基本上包含整個標準函式庫，且通常也包含許多附加的組"
"件；而在類 Unix 作業系統方面，Python 通常是以一系列的套件被安裝，因此對於某些"
"或全部的可選組件，可能都必須使用該作業系統提供的套件管理工具來安裝。"

"In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of "
"hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to "
"packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the "
"`Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_."

"在標準函式庫之外，還有成千上萬且不斷增加的組件（從個別的程式、模組、套件到完"
"整的應用程式開發框架），可以從 `Python 套件索引 (Python Package Index) "
"<https://pypi.org>`_ 中取得。"
