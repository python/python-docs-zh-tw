"The functions below make it possible for an extension to fire monitoring "

"accepts a ``PyMonitoringState`` struct which contains concise information "
"about the activation state of events, as well as the event arguments, which "
"include a ``PyObject*`` representing the code object, the instruction offset "
"and sometimes additional, event-specific arguments (see :mod:`sys."
"monitoring` for details about the signatures of the different event "
"callbacks). The ``codelike`` argument should be an instance of :class:`types."

"Enter a monitored scope. ``event_types`` is an array of the event IDs for "

"``PY_START`` event is the value ``PY_MONITORING_EVENT_PY_START``, which is "
"numerically equal to the base-2 logarithm of ``sys.monitoring.events."
"PY_START``. ``state_array`` is an array with a monitoring state entry for "
"each event in ``event_types``, it is allocated by the user but populated by :"
"c:func:`!PyMonitoring_EnterScope` with information about the activation "
"state of the event. The size of ``event_types`` (and hence also of "
