"The functions in this chapter are specific to certain Python object types. "
"Passing them an object of the wrong type is not a good idea; if you receive "
"an object from a Python program and you are not sure that it has the right "
"type, you must perform a type check first; for example, to check that an "
"object is a dictionary, use :c:func:`PyDict_Check`.  The chapter is "
"structured like the \"family tree\" of Python object types."
msgstr ""
"此章節列出的函式僅能接受某些特定的 Python 物件型別，將錯誤型別的物件傳遞給它"
"們並不是什麼好事，如果你從 Python 程式當中接收到一個不確定是否為正確型別的物"
"件，那麼請一定要先做型別檢查。例如使用 :c:func:`PyDict_Check` 來確認一個物件"
"是否為字典。本章結構類似於 Python 物件型別的\"族譜圖 (family tree)\"。"

"While the functions described in this chapter carefully check the type of "
"the objects which are passed in, many of them do not check for ``NULL`` "
"being passed instead of a valid object.  Allowing ``NULL`` to be passed in "
"can cause memory access violations and immediate termination of the "
"interpreter."
msgstr ""
"雖然本章所述之函式仔細地檢查了傳入物件的型別，但大多並無檢查是否為 `NULL``。"
"允許 ``NULL`` 的傳入可能造成記憶體的不合法存取和直譯器的立即中止。"
