"The functions in this chapter interact with Python objects regardless of "
"their type, or with wide classes of object types (e.g. all numerical types, "
"or all sequence types).  When used on object types for which they do not "
"apply, they will raise a Python exception."
msgstr ""
"本章中的函式與 Python 物件相互作用，無論其型別、或具有廣泛類別的物件型別（例"
"如所有數值型別或所有序列型別）。當使用於不適用的物件型別時，他們會引發一個 "
"Python 異常 (exception)。"

"It is not possible to use these functions on objects that are not properly "
"initialized, such as a list object that has been created by :c:func:"
"`PyList_New`, but whose items have not been set to some non-\\ ``NULL`` "
"value yet."
msgstr ""
"這些函式是不可能用於未正確初始化的物件（例如一個由 :c:func:`PyList_New` 建立"
"的 list 物件），而其中的項目沒有被設為一些非 ``NULL`` 的值。"
