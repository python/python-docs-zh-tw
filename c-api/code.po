"Code objects are a low-level detail of the CPython implementation. Each one "
"represents a chunk of executable code that hasn't yet been bound into a "
"function."

"The C structure of the objects used to describe code objects.  The fields of "
"this type are subject to change at any time."

"This is an instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` representing the Python :class:"
"`code` type."

"Return true if *co* is a :class:`code` object.  This function always "

"Return a new code object.  If you need a dummy code object to create a "
"frame, use :c:func:`PyCode_NewEmpty` instead.  Calling :c:func:`PyCode_New` "
"directly can bind you to a precise Python version since the definition of "
"the bytecode changes often."

"Return a new empty code object with the specified filename, function name, "

"resulting code object."

"Return the line number of the instruction that occurs on or before "
