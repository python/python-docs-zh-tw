"Argument Clinic is considered internal-only for CPython.  Its use is not "

"maintain an external C extension for CPython, you're welcome to experiment "
"with Argument Clinic in your own code.  But the version of Argument Clinic "

msgid "The goals of Argument Clinic"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:51
msgid ""
"Argument Clinic's primary goal is to take over responsibility for all "
"argument parsing code inside CPython.  This means that, when you convert a "
"function to work with Argument Clinic, that function should no longer do any "
"of its own argument parsing—the code generated by Argument Clinic should be "
"a \"black box\" to you, where CPython calls in at the top, and your code "
"gets called at the bottom, with ``PyObject *args`` (and maybe ``PyObject "
"*kwargs``) magically converted into the C variables and types you need."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:61
msgid ""
"In order for Argument Clinic to accomplish its primary goal, it must be easy "
"to use.  Currently, working with CPython's argument parsing library is a "
"chore, requiring maintaining redundant information in a surprising number of "
"places. When you use Argument Clinic, you don't have to repeat yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:67
msgid ""
"Obviously, no one would want to use Argument Clinic unless it's solving "
"their problem—and without creating new problems of its own. So it's "
"paramount that Argument Clinic generate correct code. It'd be nice if the "
"code was faster, too, but at the very least it should not introduce a major "
"speed regression.  (Eventually Argument Clinic *should* make a major speedup "
"possible—we could rewrite its code generator to produce tailor-made argument "
"parsing code, rather than calling the general-purpose CPython argument "
"parsing library.  That would make for the fastest argument parsing possible!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:79
msgid ""
"Additionally, Argument Clinic must be flexible enough to work with any "
"approach to argument parsing.  Python has some functions with some very "
"strange parsing behaviors; Argument Clinic's goal is to support all of them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:84
msgid ""
"Finally, the original motivation for Argument Clinic was to provide "
"introspection \"signatures\" for CPython builtins. It used to be, the "
"introspection query functions would throw an exception if you passed in a "
"builtin.  With Argument Clinic, that's a thing of the past!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/clinic.rst:90
msgid ""
"One idea you should keep in mind, as you work with Argument Clinic: the more "
"information you give it, the better job it'll be able to do. Argument Clinic "
"is admittedly relatively simple right now.  But as it evolves it will get "
"more sophisticated, and it should be able to do many interesting and smart "
"things with all the information you give it."
