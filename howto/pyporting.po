"In Python 2 you could use the ``str`` type for both text and binary data. "
"Unfortunately this confluence of two different concepts could lead to "

"It also could lead to confusing APIs if people didn't explicitly state that "

"``unicode`` when they claimed text data support."

"Python 3 made text and binary data distinct types that cannot simply be "

"Decide which APIs take text and which take binary (it is **highly** "

"``unicode`` and those that work with binary data work with the ``bytes`` "
"type from Python 3 (which is a subset of ``str`` in Python 2 and acts as an "
"alias for ``bytes`` type in Python 2). Usually the biggest issue is "
"realizing which methods exist on which types in Python 2 and 3 "

"Making the distinction easier to handle can be accomplished by encoding and "

"The next issue is making sure you know whether the string literals in your "

"textual access (allowing text data to be read and/or written). You should "
"also use :func:`io.open` for opening files instead of the built-in :func:"
"`open` function as the :mod:`io` module is consistent from Python 2 to 3 "
"while the built-in :func:`open` function is not (in Python 3 it's actually :"

"The constructors of both ``str`` and ``bytes`` have different semantics for "

"give you a bytes object as long as the integer specified, filled with null "
"bytes: ``bytes(3) == b'\\x00\\x00\\x00'``. A similar worry is necessary when "
"passing a bytes object to ``str``. In Python 2 you just get the bytes object "

"Finally, the indexing of binary data requires careful handling (slicing does "
"**not** require any special handling). In Python 2, ``b'123'[1] == b'2'`` "
"while in Python 3 ``b'123'[1] == 50``. Because binary data is simply a "
"collection of binary numbers, Python 3 returns the integer value for the "
"byte you index on. But in Python 2 because ``bytes == str``, indexing "
"returns a one-item slice of bytes. The six_ project has a function named "
"``six.indexbytes()`` which will return an integer like in Python 3: ``six."
