"Standard builds of Python include an object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk "
"widget set, called :ref:`tkinter <Tkinter>`.  This is probably the easiest "
"to install (since it comes included with most `binary distributions <https://"
"www.python.org/downloads/>`_ of Python) and use. For more info about Tk, "
"including pointers to the source, see the `Tcl/Tk home page <https://www.tcl."
"tk>`_.  Tcl/Tk is fully portable to the macOS, Windows, and Unix platforms."

msgid ""
"Freeze is a tool to create stand-alone applications.  When freezing Tkinter "
"applications, the applications will not be truly stand-alone, as the "
"application will still need the Tcl and Tk libraries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:45
msgid ""
"One solution is to ship the application with the Tcl and Tk libraries, and "
"point to them at run-time using the :envvar:`TCL_LIBRARY` and :envvar:"
"`TK_LIBRARY` environment variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:49
msgid ""
"To get truly stand-alone applications, the Tcl scripts that form the library "
"have to be integrated into the application as well. One tool supporting that "
"is SAM (stand-alone modules), which is part of the Tix distribution (http://"
"tix.sourceforge.net/)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:54
msgid ""
"Build Tix with SAM enabled, perform the appropriate call to :c:func:"
"`Tclsam_init`, etc. inside Python's :file:`Modules/tkappinit.c`, and link "
"with libtclsam and libtksam (you might include the Tix libraries as well)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:63
msgid ""
"On platforms other than Windows, yes, and you don't even need threads!  But "
"you'll have to restructure your I/O code a bit.  Tk has the equivalent of "
"Xt's :c:func:`XtAddInput()` call, which allows you to register a callback "
"function which will be called from the Tk mainloop when I/O is possible on a "
"file descriptor.  See :ref:`tkinter-file-handlers`."

"An often-heard complaint is that event handlers bound to events with the :"
"meth:`bind` method don't get handled even when the appropriate key is "
"pressed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:76
msgid ""
"The most common cause is that the widget to which the binding applies "
"doesn't have \"keyboard focus\".  Check out the Tk documentation for the "
"focus command. Usually a widget is given the keyboard focus by clicking in "
"it (but not for labels; see the takefocus option)."
