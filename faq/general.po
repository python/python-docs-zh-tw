"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming "
"language.  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high "
"level dynamic data types, and classes.  It supports multiple programming "
"paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and "
"functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear "
"syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to "
"various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as "
"an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. "
"Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux "
"and macOS, and on Windows."
