"Unless you use some sort of integrated development environment, you will end "

"You need to realize that your Python scripts have to be processed by another "
"program called the Python *interpreter*.  The interpreter reads your script, "
"compiles it into bytecodes, and then executes the bytecodes to run your "
"program. So, how do you arrange for the interpreter to handle your Python?"

msgid ""
"First, you need to make sure that your command window recognises the word "
"\"py\" as an instruction to start the interpreter.  If you have opened a "
"command window, you should try entering the command ``py`` and hitting "

"You have started the interpreter in \"interactive mode\". That means you can "

msgid ""
"Many people use the interactive mode as a convenient yet highly programmable "
"calculator.  When you want to end your interactive Python session, call the :"

"You may also find that you have a Start-menu entry such as :menuselection:"
"`Start --> Programs --> Python 3.x --> Python (command line)` that results "

"disappear after you call the :func:`exit` function or enter the :kbd:`Ctrl-"
"Z` character; Windows is running a single \"python\" command in the window, "

"Now that we know the ``py`` command is recognized, you can give your Python "

"On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py "
"extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open "
"command that runs the interpreter (``D:\\Program Files\\Python\\python.exe "
"\"%1\" %*``).  This is enough to make scripts executable from the command "
"prompt as 'foo.py'.  If you'd rather be able to execute the script by simple "

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:126
msgid ""
"Usually Python starts very quickly on Windows, but occasionally there are "
"bug reports that Python suddenly begins to take a long time to start up.  "
"This is made even more puzzling because Python will work fine on other "
"Windows systems which appear to be configured identically."

msgid ""
"The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking software "
"on the problem machine.  Some virus scanners have been known to introduce "
"startup overhead of two orders of magnitude when the scanner is configured "
"to monitor all reads from the filesystem.  Try checking the configuration of "
"virus scanning software on your systems to ensure that they are indeed "
"configured identically. McAfee, when configured to scan all file system read "
"activity, is a particular offender."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:150
msgid ""
"Yes, .pyd files are dll's, but there are a few differences.  If you have a "
"DLL named ``foo.pyd``, then it must have a function ``PyInit_foo()``.  You "
"can then write Python \"import foo\", and Python will search for foo.pyd (as "
"well as foo.py, foo.pyc) and if it finds it, will attempt to call "
"``PyInit_foo()`` to initialize it.  You do not link your .exe with foo.lib, "
"as that would cause Windows to require the DLL to be present."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:157
msgid ""
"Note that the search path for foo.pyd is PYTHONPATH, not the same as the "
"path that Windows uses to search for foo.dll.  Also, foo.pyd need not be "
"present to run your program, whereas if you linked your program with a dll, "
"the dll is required.  Of course, foo.pyd is required if you want to say "
"``import foo``.  In a DLL, linkage is declared in the source code with "
"``__declspec(dllexport)``. In a .pyd, linkage is defined in a list of "

"Do _not_ build Python into your .exe file directly.  On Windows, Python must "
"be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLL's.  (This is "
"the first key undocumented fact.)  Instead, link to :file:`python{NN}.dll`; "
"it is typically installed in ``C:\\Windows\\System``.  *NN* is the Python "
"version, a number such as \"33\" for Python 3.3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:176
msgid ""
"You can link to Python in two different ways.  Load-time linking means "
"linking against :file:`python{NN}.lib`, while run-time linking means linking "
"against :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  (General note: :file:`python{NN}.lib` is "
"the so-called \"import lib\" corresponding to :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  It "
"merely defines symbols for the linker.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:182
msgid ""
"Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run "
"time.  Your code must load :file:`python{NN}.dll` using the Windows "
"``LoadLibraryEx()`` routine.  The code must also use access routines and "
"data in :file:`python{NN}.dll` (that is, Python's C API's) using pointers "
"obtained by the Windows ``GetProcAddress()`` routine.  Macros can make using "
"these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Python's C "
"API."

"If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python \"extension module\" that "
"will make the app's data and methods available to Python.  SWIG will handle "
"just about all the grungy details for you.  The result is C code that you "
"link *into* your .exe file (!)  You do _not_ have to create a DLL file, and "
"this also simplifies linking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:200
msgid ""
"SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the "
"name of the extension module.  For example, if the name of the module is "
"leo, the init function will be called initleo().  If you use SWIG shadow "
"classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc().  This "
"initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:206
msgid ""
"The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that "
"calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module "
"into Python! (This is the second key undocumented fact.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:210

"In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python "
"interpreter with your extension module."

"There are two problems with Python's C API which will become apparent if you "
"use a compiler other than MSVC, the compiler used to build pythonNN.dll."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:224
msgid ""
"Problem 1: The so-called \"Very High Level\" functions that take FILE * "
"arguments will not work in a multi-compiler environment because each "
"compiler's notion of a struct FILE will be different.  From an "
"implementation standpoint these are very _low_ level functions."

"Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to "
"void functions:"

"Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data "
"structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll.  Again, this code will "
"fail in a mult-compiler environment.  Replace such code by:"

"It may be possible to use SWIG's ``%typemap`` command to make the change "
"automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (I'm a "
"complete SWIG newbie)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:250
msgid ""
"Using a Python shell script to put up a Python interpreter window from "
"inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be "
"independent of your app's windowing system.  Rather, you (or the "
"wxPythonWindow class) should create a \"native\" interpreter window.  It is "
"easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter.  You can redirect "
"Python's i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need "

"Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea.  MSVC is no "
