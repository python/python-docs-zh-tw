msgid ""
"First, it's more obvious that you are using a method or instance attribute "
"instead of a local variable.  Reading ``self.x`` or ``self.meth()`` makes it "
"absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you "
"don't know the class definition by heart.  In C++, you can sort of tell by "
"the lack of a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or "
"easily recognizable) -- but in Python, there are no local variable "
"declarations, so you'd have to look up the class definition to be sure.  "
"Some C++ and Java coding standards call for instance attributes to have an "
"``m_`` prefix, so this explicitness is still useful in those languages, too."
msgstr ""
"第一，這樣可以更明顯表現出你在用方法 (method) 或是實例 (instance) 的屬性，而"
"非一個區域變數。即使不知道類別 (class) 的定義，當看到 ``self.x`` 或 ``self."
"meth()``，就會很清楚地知道是正在使用實例的變數或是方法。在 C++ 裡，你可以藉由"
"沒有區域變數宣告來判斷這件事 ── 但在 Python 裡沒有區域變數宣告，所以你必須去"
"看類別的定義來確定。有些 C++ 和 Java 的程式碼規格要求要在實例屬性的名稱加上前"
"綴 ``m_``，所以這種明確性在那些語言也是很好用的。"

#: ../../faq/design.rst:127
msgid ""
"Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to "
"explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class.  In C++, if "
"you want to use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived "
"class, you have to use the ``::`` operator -- in Python you can write "
"``baseclass.methodname(self, <argument list>)``.  This is particularly "
"useful for :meth:`~object.__init__` methods, and in general in cases where a "
"derived class method wants to extend the base class method of the same name "
"and thus has to call the base class method somehow."
msgstr ""
"第二，當你想明確地使用或呼叫在某個類別裡的方法的時候，你不需要特殊的語法。在 "
"C++ 裡，如果你想用一個在繼承類別時被覆寫的基底類別方法，必須要用 ``::`` 運算"
"子 -- 但在 Python 裡，你可以直接寫成 ``baseclass.methodname(self, <argument "

"擴充基底類別的方法而要呼叫他時。"

#: ../../faq/design.rst:136
msgid ""
"Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with "
"assignment: since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those "
"variables to which a value is assigned in a function body (and that aren't "
"explicitly declared global), there has to be some way to tell the "
"interpreter that an assignment was meant to assign to an instance variable "
"instead of to a local variable, and it should preferably be syntactic (for "
"efficiency reasons).  C++ does this through declarations, but Python doesn't "
"have declarations and it would be a pity having to introduce them just for "
"this purpose.  Using the explicit ``self.var`` solves this nicely.  "
"Similarly, for using instance variables, having to write ``self.var`` means "
"that references to unqualified names inside a method don't have to search "
"the instance's directories.  To put it another way, local variables and "
"instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need to tell "
"Python which namespace to use."
msgstr ""
"最後，他解決了關於實例變數指派的語法問題：因為區域變數在 Python 是（定義為）"
"在函式內被指派值的變數（且沒有被明確宣告成全域），所以會需要一個方法來告訴直"
"譯器這個指派運算是針對實例變數，而非針對區域變數，這在語法層面處理較好（為了"
"效率）。C++ 用宣告解決了這件事，但 Python 沒有，而為了這個原因而引入變數宣告"
"機制又略嫌浪費。但使用明確的 ``self.var`` 就可以把這個問題圓滿解決。同理，在"
"用實例變數的時候必須寫成 ``self.var`` 即代表對於在方法中不特定的名稱不需要去"
"看實例的內容。換句話說，區域變數和實例變數存在於兩個不同的命名空間 "
