"Python allows the writer of a C extension module to define new types that "
"can be manipulated from Python code, much like the built-in :class:`str` "
"and :class:`list` types.  The code for all extension types follows a "
"pattern, but there are some details that you need to understand before you "
"can get started.  This document is a gentle introduction to the topic."

"The :term:`CPython` runtime sees all Python objects as variables of type :c:"
"expr:`PyObject*`, which serves as a \"base type\" for all Python objects. "
"The :c:type:`PyObject` structure itself only contains the object's :term:"
"`reference count` and a pointer to the object's \"type object\". This is "
"where the action is; the type object determines which (C) functions get "
"called by the interpreter when, for instance, an attribute gets looked up on "
"an object, a method called, or it is multiplied by another object.  These C "
"functions are called \"type methods\"."
