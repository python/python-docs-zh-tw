"A C extension for CPython is a shared library (e.g. a ``.so`` file on Linux, "

"To be importable, the shared library must be available on :envvar:"
"`PYTHONPATH`, and must be named after the module name, with an appropriate "

"It is possible to export multiple modules from a single shared library by "
